DESCRIPTION

    IRB history captured as Test::Unit tests. (RSpec and others hopefully soon to come.)

INSTALL

    1. gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org
    2. sudo gem install butterfly_net
    3. To automatically require butterfly_net on every IRB session, add the following to your ~/.irbrc:

        require 'rubygems'
        require 'butterfly_net'

USAGE

    Command methods:

    bn, bn_open    - Open an active test case, with optional string arg file_name ('.rb' is appended if needed)
    bnc, bn_close  - Close the active test case, and write the output to a file

    Ruby on Rails console:

    For repeatable tests, be sure to load the Rails test environment with "./script/console test".
    In a Rails project, you can run all tests with the standard rake command 'rake test',
    or an individual test by adding the test directory to the path with the option -I when you invoke Ruby.

    chris$ ./script/console test
    Loading test environment (Rails 2.3.4)
    >> bn "test/unit/person_console_test"
    . . .
    >> Person.count
    => 2
    >> exit
    . . .
    chris$ ruby -Itest test/unit/person_console_test.rb
    . . .
    1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
