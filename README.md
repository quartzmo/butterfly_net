Butterfly Net
=============

## DESCRIPTION

IRB and Rails console history captured as Test::Unit tests. (RSpec and others hopefully soon to come.)


## INSTALL

    gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org
    sudo gem install butterfly_net

To automatically require Butterfly Net on every IRB session, add the following to your ~/.irbrc:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'butterfly_net'


## USAGE

### Command methods

* bn, bn_open- Open a new test case, closing the current test case if one exists. Args: file_name:string (optional; '.rb' will appended if needed)
* bnc, bn_close  - Close the active test case, and write the output to a file.
* m, bn_method   - Close the current test method (or block), naming it with the arg method_name:string (optional)

### Ruby on Rails console

For repeatable tests, be sure to load the Rails test environment with "./script/console test".
In a Rails project, you can run all tests with the standard rake command 'rake test',
or an individual test by adding the test directory to the path with the option -I when you invoke Ruby.

    chris$ ./script/console test
    Loading test environment (Rails 2.3.4)
    >> bn "test/unit/person_console_test"
    . . .
    >> Person.count
    => 2
    >> exit
    . . .
    chris$ ruby -Itest test/unit/person_console_test.rb
    . . .
    1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors


## KNOWN ISSUES

Butterfly Net tries to detect simple assignments, such as "a = 1", in order to write them out clearly,
without enclosing assertions. In some cases this causes it to miss statements that should be tested.
For example:

    irb(main):002:0> a = 1; a + 1
    => 2
    irb(main):003:0> "a=1".split('=')
    => ["a", "1"]

results in

    def test_1
      a = 1; a + 1  # should have been a = 1; assert_equal(2, a + 1)
      "a=1".split('=')  # should have been assert_equal(["a", "1"],"a=1".split('='))
    end

In order to avoid this issue, just put assignments (and anything that looks like an assignment) on separate lines.
